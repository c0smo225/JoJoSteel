[This mod is a fork of Novarch129's mod.](https://github.com/Novarch129/JoJo-s-Bizarre-Survival)
-------------------------------------------
<p>This mod is based on the <strong>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</strong> manga and anime series by <strong>Hirohiko Araki</strong> (荒木 飛呂彦).</p>

<p>This mod aims to expand upon Novarch129's JoJo's-Bizarre-Survival mod. The primary aim is to add in new stands that I think are cool. However, there will be bugfixes and new additions, such as Hamon and Spin.</p>
<p>I am new to Java programming and Minecraft modding. So updates will be slow.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">FAQ:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Will this mod be updated to the latest versions of Minecraft?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">- If I can somehow magically become a goated programmer, then sure.</span></p>
